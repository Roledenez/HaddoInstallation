You seem to start the dev server, the command should look like

./build/env/bin/hue runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
if you want it to be accessible from another host (and probably need a nohup ... &).

Note that

./build/env/bin/hue runcpserver
is the correct command for starting the production server.

You can also check with hue.ini is picked-up later by looking at the /dump_config page when you can access it.
